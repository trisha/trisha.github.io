https://dev.to/yuribenjamin/how-to-deploy-react-app-in-github-pages-2a1f

Then, in your repo settings, have your Github pages be set to the gh-pages branch that gets created for you.

Run 'npm run deploy' to deploy your site. (Then go back to GitHub Pages [settings](https://github.com/trishapan/trishapan.github.io/settings/pages) to re-add custom domain as trishapan.com since that usually gets overwritten)

# How to run locally
Run `nodemon`

Go to `http://localhost:3000/` if it doesn't already

# How to push updates
Push your updates in the main/master branch

Run `npm run deploy`

Go to GitHub Pages [settings](https://github.com/trisha/trisha.github.io/settings/pages) to re-add 'trishapan.com' as the custom domain

Wait around 7 minutes to see website update
